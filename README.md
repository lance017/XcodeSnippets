I an so lazy that I've been looking for a way to code automatically.ðŸ˜†

Luckily we have snippets for Xcode.

```shell
python build_snippets.py
```

## Usage

Type the tip keyword and select the snippet.

For objective-c:

For swift:

Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions. 

And I will be very grateful to anyone for providing any useful snippets.
